Potential bias 

The algorithms that are used in data science, of course, are value neutral in and of themselves. They don't have opinions. But the algorithms are only as neutral as the rules and the data that they are given by the programmers 

Overconfidence

Data science analyses are limited simplifications. Every analysis is a simplification. You still need humans in the loop. You have the problem of people believing that if it came through a machine learning algorithm, it must be the truth, it must be the right thing, without realizing both the bias and the problems of interpretation that still result. People are still needed here. 

- Data science has potential and risks
- Analyses are not value neutral
- Judgment is always needed
